# Browser Quest

In this assignment we are creating a simple browser based role-playing game that allows the player to embark on a quest to save the kingdom! The player is able to choose their name and other options to customize their character. Their journey through this fantasy setting will take them through a series of battles in which health and attack points are calculated and tracked. The player will discover additional game options as they progress on their quest. If the player falls in battle, the game is over and a score is recorded.
